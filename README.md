# click-counter-game
My first game! It’s a simple starting point, and I’ll be gradually enhancing it with new features over time.

v1.0: Add the basic HTML structure, including:
-An <h1> element and two <p> elements containing text
-A button that the user clicks
-A counter that tracks the number of clicks
-JavaScript to store the click count and update the counter accordingly and to "restart the game"

v1.1
-Display a celebratory message every 100 completed clicks.

v1.2
-Implement test cases using Jest.

v1.3
-Add a leaderboard displaying the top 10 highest scores.

v1.4
-Allow players to enter their name and store it in the leaderboard.
